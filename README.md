# React
### What is Emmet?
Emmet is an essential toolkit for web-developers. It allows you to type shortcuts that are expanded into full piece of code for writing HTML and CSS, Based on an abbreviations most developers are able to write full-fledged HTML markup and CSS rules.

### Difference between Library and Framework?
A Library is a collection of packages that performs specific operations whereas Framework contains a basic flow and architecture of an application. The basic difference between them is complexity. Library contains numerous methods that a developer can just call them whenever they write code. React.js is a Libray whereas Angular is a Framework of JavaScript. The framework provides the flow of a software application and tells the developer what it needs and calls the code provided by the developer as required. If a library is used, the application calls the code from the library.

### What is CDN? Why do we use it?
A Content Delivery Network(CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of severs that work together for fast delivery of Internet content. The main use of CDN is to deliver content through a network of servers in a secure and efficient way.

### Why is React known as React?
React is named React because of its ability to `react to changes` in data. React is called React because it was designed to be a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The name React was chosen because the library was designed to allow developers to "react" to changes in state and data within an application, and to update the user interface in a declarative and efficient manner. React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. Facebook and an open-source developer community run it.

### What is crossorigin in script tag?


### Is jsx mandatory for react?
JSX is not a requirement for using React. Using React without JSX is especially convenient when you don’t want to set up compilation in your build environment. JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods. JSX converts HTML tags into react elements. You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications.

### Is ES6 is mandatory for react?
ES6 is not mandatory for React but is highly recommendable. The latest projects created on React rely a lot on ES6. React uses ES6, and you should be familiar with some of the new features like: Classes, Arrow Functions, Variables(let, const). ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6. ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015.

### {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX?
The Difference is stated below:
- `{TitleComponent}`: This value describes the `TitleComponent` as a javascript expression or a variable or React element. 
The `{}` can embed a javascript expression or a variable or React element inside it.
- `<TitleComponent/>` : This value represents a Component that is basically returning Some JSX value. In simple terms `TitleComponent` a function that is returning a JSX value. If component is written inside the `{<  />}` expression.
- `<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>` :  `<TitleComponent />` and `<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>` are equivalent only when `< TitleComponent />` has no child components. The opening and closing tags are created to include the child components.
#### Example
```
<TitleComponent>
    <FirstChildComponent />
    <SecondChildComponent />
    <ThirdChildComponent />
</TitleComponent>
```

### How can I write `comments` in JSX?
JSX comments are written as follows:
- `{/*  */}` - for single or multiline comments
#### Example

{/* A JSX comment */}
{/* 
  Multi
  line
  JSX
  comment
*/}  

### What is `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>`?
`<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` is a feature in React that allows you to return multiple elements from a React component by allowing you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
`<></>` is the shorthand tag for `React.Fragment`. The only difference between them is that the shorthand version does not support the key attribute.
#### Example
```
return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <Header />
            <Navigation />
            <Main />
            <Footer />
        </React.Fragment>
    );

return (
        <>
            <Header />
            <Navigation />
            <Main />
            <Footer />
        </>
    );
```

### What is Virtual DOM?
The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation. "virtual DOM" is more of a pattern than a specific technology. In React world, the term “virtual DOM” is usually associated with React elements since they are the objects representing the user interface. React, however, also uses internal objects called “fibers” to hold additional information about the component tree. They may also be considered a part of “virtual DOM” implementation in React.

### What is Reconciliation in React?
`Reconciliation` is the process through which React updates the Browser DOM and makes React work faster. React use a `diffing algorithm` so that component updates are predictable and faster. React would first calculate the difference between the real DOM and the copy of DOM (Virtual DOM) when there's an update of components.
React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called `Virtual DOM`. When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one. Comparison is done by `Diffing Algorithm`.
React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM. It finds out the changed nodes and updates only the changed nodes in Real DOM leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called Reconciliation.

###  What is `React Fiber`?
React Fiber is a concept of ReactJS that is used to render a system faster, smoother and smarter.
The Fiber reconciler, which became the default reconciler for React 16 and above, is a complete rewrite of React’s reconciliation algorithm to solve some long-standing issues in React.
Because Fiber is asynchronous, React can:
- Pause, resume, and restart rendering work on components as new updates come in
- Reuse previously completed work and even abort it if not needed
- Split work into chunks and prioritize tasks based on importance

### Why do we need `keys` in React?
In order to solve this issue, React supports a key attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree. For example, adding a key to our inefficient example above can make the tree conversion efficient:
### Example
```
<ul>
  <li key="2015">Duke</li>
  <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li key="2014">Connecticut</li>
  <li key="2015">Duke</li>
  <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
</ul>
```

### Can we use index as keys in React?
Yes, we can use the `index as keys`, but it is not considered as a good practice to use them because if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.
Keys are taken from each object which is being rendered. There might be a possibility that if we modify the incoming data react may render them in unusual order.

### What is `props in React`? Ways to.
Props stands for properties. Props are arguments passed into React components. props are used in React to pass data from one component to another (from a parent component to a child component(s)). They are useful when you want the flow of data in your app to be dynamic.
#### Example
```
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Tool name="Chetan Nada" tool="Figma"/> // name and tool are props
    </div>
  )
}
```
### What is `Config Driven UI`?
`Config Driven UI` are based on the configurations of the data application receives. It is rather a good practice to use config driven UIs to make application for dynamic. 
It is a very common & basic approach to interact with the User. It provides a generic interface to develop things which help your project scale well. It saves a lot of development time and effort.
A typical login form, common in most of the Apps. Most of these forms also get frequent updates as the requirements increase in terms of Form Validations, dropdown options,.. or design changes.

### Difference between `Virtual DOM` and `Real DOM`?
DOM stands for `Document Object Model`, which represents your application UI and whenever the changes are made in the application, this DOM gets updated and the user is able to visualize the changes. DOM is an interface that allows scripts to update the content, style, and structure of the document.
- `Virtual DOM`
    - The Virtual DOM is a light-weight abstraction of the DOM. You can think of it as a copy of the DOM, that can be updated without affecting the actual DOM. It has all the same properties as the real DOM object, but doesn’t have the ability to write to the screen like the real DOM.
    - Virtual DOM is just like a blueprint of a machine, can do the changes in the blueprint but those changes will not directly apply to the machine.
    - Reconciliation is a process to compare and keep in sync the two files (Real and Virtual DOM). Diffing algorithm is a technique of reconciliation which is used by React.
- `Real DOM`
    - The DOM represents the web page often called a document with a logical tree and each  branch of the tree ends in a node and each node contains object programmers can modify the content of the document using a scripting language like javascript and the changes and updates to the dom are fast because of its tree-like structure but after changes, the updated element and its children have to be re-rendered to update the application UI so the  re-rendering of the UI which make the dom slow all the UI components you need to be rendered for every dom update so real dom would render the entire list and not only those item that receives the update .

|   `Real DOM`    |   `Virtual DOM` |
|-------------|-----------------|
| DOM manipulation is very expensive  | DOM manipulation is very easy  | 
| There is too much memory wastage  | No memory wastage  |
| It updates Slow | It updates fast |
| It can directly update HTML | It can’t update HTML directly  |
|  Creates a new DOM if the element updates. | Update the JSX if the element update |
| It allows us to directly target any specific node (HTML element) | It can produce about 200,000 Virtual DOM Nodes / Second. |
| It represents the UI of your application | It is only a virtual representation of the DOM |
